# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description 

In this project, you are able to see additions and changes I have made within my JavaScript code. These changes were made to generate a random password for the user. As a user, we wanted to be able to create this password using "functions" and "variables" as well as "for" loops. 

When the user runs through the prompts, they are given the required unique password that we have goded to generate in JavaScript. 

## Installation 

1. From the "Password-Generator" repository (https://github.com/RG-GitUser/Password-Generator) select the "Code" dropdown.
2. Using the "Code" dropdown, click on "SSH".
3. On the "SSH" tab, select the "copy" button next to  the address.
4. Next, open your git bash terminal (or for mac users, homebrew)
5. Use the command "git clone" and "insert coppied SSH key here" then press enter. 
6. Enter the "cd "enter path here" " command to navigate to the correct directory. 
7. You now have the repository cloned to your system! To verify, the command "ls" to view the items listed inside of the repository.

## Usage 

Here we can understand how the functionallity of generating a random password works. 

Below is an example of code that generates the random password:
